## [Unreleased]

### Added

-   Added configurable MySQL connection pool settings (`pool_size`, `max_overflow`, `pool_pre_ping`, `pool_recycle`) via server config YAML
-   Added pool health monitoring that warns at 80% capacity
-   Added `mysql` pytest marker for tests requiring MySQL and Docker
-   Added performance test suite (`empire/test/test_performance/`) for pool exhaustion and event loop blocking regression testing

### Changed

-   Agent check-in uses single INSERT with ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE / ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING instead of SELECT-then-INSERT (2 queries → 1)
-   All FastAPI route handlers converted from `async def` to `def`. FastAPI now dispatches every handler to a thread pool, preventing synchronous SQLAlchemy calls from blocking the uvicorn event loop. Handlers that previously offloaded work via `asyncio.to_thread()` no longer need to — the thread pool provides the same isolation automatically.
-   High-frequency hooks (`AFTER_AGENT_CALLBACK_HOOK`, `AFTER_TASKING_RESULT_HOOK`, `AFTER_AGENT_CHECKIN_HOOK`, `AFTER_TASKING_HOOK`) now fire with `None` as the session argument. `_run_async_hook` and `run_hooks` provide a fresh managed session to hook callbacks, eliminating the 2x connection amplification that occurred when hooks opened a second connection while the caller still held the first.

### Removed

-   Removed legacy `archive` field from `empire_compiler` config; use `repo` and `ref` instead

### Fixed

-   Fixed DB pool exhaustion under concurrent load causing 503/504 cascading failures. The root cause was hook connection amplification: async hooks called inside DB session blocks opened a second pool connection via `_run_async_hook` while the caller still held the first, doubling connection usage per check-in.
-   Fixed event loop blocking across all API endpoints. Previously only stager, listener, and plugin endpoints were addressed; now all 216 handlers use `def` to prevent any synchronous DB call from blocking the event loop.
-   Fixed unnecessary GitHub API call on every server startup when the compiler is already cached locally
-   Fixed unhandled `TagInvalidException` in `parse_routing_packet` that caused request crashes from stale agents or non-agent traffic
-   Fixed `TypeError` in BOF module parameter packing when integer values were passed to options that require space-checking

## [6.5.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added

-   Log Empire version and git commit SHA at startup for easier production diagnostics; commit SHA is baked into the Docker image at build time via `--build-arg`
-   Added C stager for lightweight stage0 shellcode injection via Fibers
-   Added `shellcode_compiler` utility for compiling position-independent C stagers into raw x64 shellcode for BOF process injection
-   Added `clipboard_window_inject_list` BOF module for enumerating processes with clipboard window class
-   Added PIC shellcode C template and linker script for MinGW-based shellcode compilation
-   Added unit tests for `shellcode_compiler` and rewrote `test_bof_packer` to cover the new `Packer` class API
-   Added `repo` and `ref` fields to `empire_compiler` config, replacing the hardcoded archive URL with GitHub Releases API asset discovery
-   Added unit tests for compiler platform resolution and download URL logic
-   Added a runtime `Background` option to C# modules, allowing operators to override background/foreground execution at task time
-   Added C# PatchETW module for in-process ETW patching via ntdll!EtwEventWrite
-   Added C# PatchlessAMSI module for patchless AMSI bypass using hardware breakpoints and vectored exception handling
-   Added PowerShell Invoke-VSSExtract module for NTDS.dit and SYSTEM hive extraction via Volume Shadow Copy
-   Added PowerShell Invoke-RDPHijack module for RDP session hijacking via tscon.exe
-   Added Python linux_keyring module for credential extraction from the Linux kernel keyring subsystem
-   Added Python aws_imds module for AWS IAM role credential theft via EC2 Instance Metadata Service
-   Added BOF `spawn` module for EarlyBird process hollowing with suspended process creation, shellcode injection, and APC thread hijacking

### Changed

-   Added Python 3.14 support (supports 3.13 and 3.14); Dockerfile now uses `python:3.14.3-trixie`
-   Replace `os.path` with `pathlib` in core code and enforce `PTH` lint rule for all core files
-   Switch `stager_generation_service` from deprecated `installPath` (str) to `install_path` (Path)
-   Optimized test suite for faster CI and local runs
-   Modernize Python patterns in core code: use `setdefault()`, truthiness checks, `click.style()` for terminal colors, and remove redundant operations
-   Reduced test fixture boilerplate with a shared `make_agent()` factory and deduplicated `plugin_task` fixture across test files
-   Removed `autouse` from test fixtures that don't need it, making test dependencies explicit
-   Added unit tests for encryption, packet handling, helpers, malleable transformations, and listener utilities
-   Migrate remaining `installPath` usages to `install_path` (Path) in core services
-   Use `Path.read_text(encoding="utf-8")` instead of `read_bytes().decode()` in stager generation
-   Replace `os.system()` calls with `subprocess.run()` in stager JAR generation
-   Upgraded all Python dependencies to latest versions (Feb 2026)
-   Replace deprecated `handle_error_message` with raised `ModuleValidationException` in all modules (#716)
-   Convert 51 modules to use `@auto_get_source` and `@auto_finalize` decorators, eliminating boilerplate (#716)
-   Replace unmaintained `terminaltables` dependency with `prettytable` (#809)
-   Refactored `bof_packer` from standalone functions to a `Packer` class with granular packing methods (`addbytes`, `addstr`, `addWstr`, `addbool`, `adduint32`, `addint`, `addshort`)
-   Rewrote `clipboard_window_inject` BOF module to use PIC shellcode instead of PowerShell launcher-based shellcode generation
-   Simplified `clipboard_window_inject` module options by removing unnecessary launcher parameters and corrected BOF format string
-   Bumped Empire Compiler from v0.4.3 to v0.4.4

### Removed

-   Removed `secinject` BOF module and its pre-compiled binary

### Fixed

-   Fixed SQLAlchemy connection pool exhaustion caused by async hooks receiving the caller's committed session. `run_hooks` now wraps async hooks in `_run_async_hook`, which opens a fresh `SessionLocal` session for each hook and closes it cleanly after the hook returns. ORM objects are re-attached via `session.merge()` so lazy-loaded relationships resolve correctly.
-   Fixed SQLAlchemy connection pool exhaustion during agent check-ins by releasing the DB session before expensive file I/O, encryption, and packet building in `handle_agent_request()`
-   Fixed custom-generate BOF modules (`clipboard_window_inject`, `spawn`, `clipboard_window_inject_list`) returning .NET-only `file|,json` format for Go agents, causing BOF execution to fail on the Go agent's COFF loader
-   Added `format_bof_output()` to `ModuleService` to centralize BOF output formatting for Go and .NET agents
-   Pass `agent_language` to custom-generate modules so they can produce agent-appropriate output
-   Fixed malleable HTTP listener stagers failing after server restart due to random URI regeneration in `Stager._defaults()`
-   Fix null-safety bug in `_process_agent_packet` when `save_module_file` returns None on skywalker exploit detection
-   Fixed stop-job handlers in PowerShell and Python agents crashing when the target job doesn't exist
-   Fixed the `docs/quickstart/installation/README.md` file to specify a previously missing reference to Ubuntu
