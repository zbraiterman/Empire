# Empire Agents Overview
This page provides an in-depth overview of the different agents available within Empire, including their capabilities, features, and usage scenarios.

## IronPython Agent
IronPython brings the Python language to the .NET framework. The IronPython agent leverages this to execute Python scripts using .NET, bypassing restrictions on native Python interpreters. Additional documentation on the agent can be found [here](./python/README.md).

### Features
- Executes in a .NET context, allowing for unique evasion techniques.
- Can interface with .NET libraries directly from Python code.
- Runs Python, C#, and PowerShell taskings.

## Python Agent
The Python agent offers cross-platform capabilities for targeting non-Windows systems, such as Linux and macOS. Additional documentation on the agent can be found [here](./python/README.md).

### Features
- Cross-platform for Linux and macOS.

## Go Agent
The Go agent (`Gopire`) is designed for use in environments where Go is advantageous for performance and portability. It is lightweight and suitable for Windows systems. **Currently, the Go agent only supports Windows and the HTTP listener.** Future updates may include cross-platform support.

### Features
- **Currently only Windows compatible.**
- Written in Go, providing performance and portability benefits.
- Can run taskings such as C#, PowerShell, and shell commands.
- Reflectively loaded to evade detection.
- **Supports only the HTTP listener.**

Additional documentation on the agent can be found [here](./go/README.md).

## C Agent
The C agent (`Cpire`) is an experimental native agent modeled after the Go agent. It compiles into a standalone binary and supports Windows and Linux targets. **Currently, the C agent supports the HTTP listener only.**

The C agent is only available in the [Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/BC-SECURITY) version of Empire.

### Features
- Cross-platform: supports Windows and Linux targets.
- Native compiled binary with no runtime dependencies.
- Runs PowerShell, C#, BOF, and shell taskings.
- Full DH key exchange staging with Ed25519 certificate verification.
- File download/upload and directory listing.
- Agent controls: delay/jitter, kill date, working hours, lost-limit enforcement.

Additional documentation on the agent can be found [here](./c/README.md).

## PowerShell Agent
The PowerShell agent is the original agent for Empire.

### Features:
- Reflectively loads into memory.
- Can run C# and PowerShell taskings.

## C# Agent
The C# agent leverages [Sharpire](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Sharpire) as the implant.

### Features
- Can run C# and PowerShell taskings.
